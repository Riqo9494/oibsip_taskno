# Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification

## Objective
The goal of this task is to classify iris flowers into different species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The classification is done using machine learning algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Files Included
- `iris_classification.ipynb`: The main notebook file for the task.
- `Iris(1).csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model, containing information on various iris flowers.

## How to Run
1. Open `iris_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib numpy
